BitOMC Overview
=======================

BitOMC is a fork of the [Runes protocol](https://docs.ordinals.com/runes.html), 
consisting of two interconvertible assets, Tighten and Ease, which users can 
convert between according to a constant function conversion rule. This keeps 
the system in balance and ensures the conversion rate reflects their relative 
market price. This conversion rate determines a dynamic interest rate, which in 
turn defines a floating unit of Bitcoin called the "util". Transactions continue 
to settle in Bitcoin, but parties seeking greater price stability may choose to 
denominate their contracts in "utils" rather than BTC or a fiat currency.

Technical details are available in [the whitepaper](https://bitomc.org/bitomc.pdf).
